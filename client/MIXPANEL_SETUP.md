## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Questions You Can Answer**

âœ… **"Which beast species have highest retention?"**
- Segment `Daily Login` by beast species
- Compare 7-day retention rates

âœ… **"What predicts user churn?"**
- Analyze `Session End` quality scores
- Look at care_urgency patterns before churn

âœ… **"When should we ask for purchases?"**  
- Track `Purchase Intent` conversion rates
- Segment by beast_urgency + user_engagement

âœ… **"What onboarding step loses most users?"**
- Build funnel from `Onboarding Step` events
- Optimize the biggest drop-off point

## ðŸ”§ **Advanced Analytics (Optional)**

### **Cohort Analysis**
```javascript
// In Mixpanel, create behavioral cohorts:
"Quick Adopters" = Completed onboarding < 10 min
"Game Focused" = 3+ games in first session  
"Care Focused" = 3+ care actions in first day
```

### **Predictive Segments**
```javascript
// Track users by engagement patterns:
churn_risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
monetization_opportunity: 'none' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'
```

## ðŸ“± **Mobile App Ready**
All events work on mobile web - no additional setup needed!
