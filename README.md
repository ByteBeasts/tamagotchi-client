## üíª Client Setup

### üß± Prerequisites

* **Node.js**
* **pnpm** (recommended for managing dependencies)
* **mkcert** (for HTTPS development)

Install mkcert (if you don‚Äôt have it):

```bash
brew install mkcert
mkcert -install
```

> *mkcert* is a simple tool for creating locally-trusted development certificates.

---

## ‚ö° Development Scenarios

### üåê Run with HTTP (default)

No HTTPS, simple local development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or explicitly:

```bash
pnpm dev:http
```

> This starts the Vite dev server on HTTP.

---

### üîê Run with HTTPS

To develop with HTTPS (required for certain features like Controller or Service Worker testing):

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Generate certificates

Run:

```bash
pnpm mkcert
```

This will generate:

* `dev.pem`
* `dev-key.pem`

These files will be automatically used by Vite if you run the HTTPS script.

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run dev server with HTTPS

```bash
pnpm dev:https
```

> This will start your app at `https://localhost:3002` (or your configured port), using the generated certificates.
